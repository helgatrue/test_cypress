# Cypress tests for Counter App

This project contains end-to-end tests for a simple counter app using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The app allows incrementing and decrementing a counter, but ensures the value never goes below 0.

## Whatâ€™s covered

### Positive Cases
1. Increment from 0 to 1
2. Decrement from 1 to 0
3. Counter must not go below 0

### Edge Cases
4. Counter value must remain unchanged
5. Rapid clicks should increment correctly
6. Counter should always show only non-negative integers

## ðŸ¤– CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Tests are automatically executed:

- On every push and pull request to the main branch 
- Using GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners 
- Headless mode + HTML reporting

## âœ… HTML report as artifact
After each CI run:

1. Navigate to the Actions tab on GitHub 
2. Open the latest workflow run 
3. Download the artifact named:
   ``cypress-html-report``
4. Unzip and open the file via browser

It includes a full MochaAwesome HTML report (``mochawesome.html``) showing test results.
